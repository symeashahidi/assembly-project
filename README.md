# assembly-project

Portfolio assignment for Computer Architecture. The program, written in low-level assembly code, obtains 10 integers from the user, calculates their sum and average, and displays the results. It manually converts the userâ€™s string inputs into integers and checks their validity. Once the calculations are complete, it converts the integers back into strings for presentation.
